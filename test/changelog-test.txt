    cfg80211: fix wdev tracing crash
    
    Arend reported a crash in tracing if the driver returns an
    ERR_PTR() value from the add_virtual_intf() callback. This
    is due to the tracing then still attempting to dereference
    the "pointer", fix this by using IS_ERR_OR_NULL().

    mac80211: fix remain-on-channel cancel crash
    
    If a ROC item is canceled just as it expires, the work
    struct may be scheduled while it is running (and waiting
    for the mutex). This results in it being run after being
    freed, which obviously crashes.
    
    To fix this don't free it when aborting is requested but
    instead mark it as "to be freed", which makes the work a
    no-op and allows freeing it outside.

    bonding: remove sysfs before removing devices
    
    We have a race condition if we try to rmmod bonding and simultaneously add
    a bond master through sysfs. In bonding_exit() we first remove the devices
    (through rtnl_link_unregister() ) and only after that we remove the sysfs.
    If we manage to add a device through sysfs after that the devices were
    removed - we'll end up with that device/sysfs structure and with the module
    unloaded.
    
    Fix this by first removing the sysfs and only after that calling
    rtnl_link_unregister().

    af_unix: If we don't care about credentials coallesce all messages
    
    It was reported that the following LSB test case failed
    https://lsbbugs.linuxfoundation.org/attachment.cgi?id=2144 because we
    were not coallescing unix stream messages when the application was
    expecting us to.
    
    The problem was that the first send was before the socket was accepted
    and thus sock->sk_socket was NULL in maybe_add_creds, and the second
    send after the socket was accepted had a non-NULL value for sk->socket
    and thus we could tell the credentials were not needed so we did not
    bother.
    
    The unnecessary credentials on the first message cause
    unix_stream_recvmsg to start verifying that all messages had the same
    credentials before coallescing and then the coallescing failed because
    the second message had no credentials.
    
    Ignoring credentials when we don't care in unix_stream_recvmsg fixes a
    long standing pessimization which would fail to coallesce messages when
    reading from a unix stream socket if the senders were different even if
    we did not care about their credentials.
    
    I have tested this and verified that the in the LSB test case mentioned
    above that the messages do coallesce now, while the were failing to
    coallesce without this change.

    Revert "af_unix: dont send SCM_CREDENTIAL when dest socket is NULL"
    
    This reverts commit 14134f6584212d585b310ce95428014b653dfaf6.
    
    The problem that the above patch was meant to address is that af_unix
    messages are not being coallesced because we are sending unnecesarry
    credentials.  Not sending credentials in maybe_add_creds totally
    breaks unconnected unix domain sockets that wish to send credentails
    to other sockets.
    
    In practice this break some versions of udev because they receive a
    message and the sending uid is bogus so they drop the message.

    bridge: fix crash when set mac address of br interface
    
    When I tried to set mac address of a bridge interface to a mac
    address which already learned on this bridge, I got system hang.
    
    The cause is straight forward: function br_fdb_change_mac_address
    calls fdb_insert with NULL source nbp. Then an fdb lookup is
    performed. If an fdb entry is found and it's local, it's OK. But
    if it's not local, source is dereferenced for printk without NULL
    check.

    After commit 21d8a15a (lookup_one_len: don't accept . and ..) reiserfs
    started failing to delete xattrs from inode. This was due to a buggy
    test for '.' and '..' in fill_with_dentries() which resulted in passing
    '.' and '..' entries to lookup_one_len() in some cases. That returned
    error and so we failed to iterate over all xattrs of and inode.
    
    Fix the test in fill_with_dentries() along the lines of the one in
    lookup_one_len().

    CONFIG_LPAE doesn't exist: the correct option is CONFIG_ARM_LPAE, so fix

    The fix to head.S is slightly scary, but this is just for setting up
    an early io-mapping for the serial port when running on a big-endian,
    LPAE system. Since these systems don't exist in the wild (at least, I
    have no access to one outside of kvmtool, which doesn't provide a serial
    port suitable for earlyprintk), then we can revisit the code later if it
    causes any problems.

    2. Send IPI to the CPUs that are running the same mm (and ASID) as the
       one being invalidated (or all the online CPUs for global pages).
    3. CPU receiving the IPI executes a DMB and CLREX (part of the exception

        Since we only enforce an upper bound, not a lower bound, a "negative"

        The symptom seen was a warning when we attempt to a kmalloc with an
        excessive size.

    Upstream commit: f853c616883a8de966873a1dab283f1369e275a1
    
    cifs: ignore everything in SPNEGO blob after mechTypes
    
    We've had several reports of people attempting to mount Windows 8 shares
    and getting failures with a return code of -EINVAL. The default sec=
    mode changed recently to sec=ntlmssp. With that, we expect and parse a
    SPNEGO blob from the server in the NEGOTIATE reply.
    
    The current decode_negTokenInit function first parses all of the
    mechTypes and then tries to parse the rest of the negTokenInit reply.
    The parser however currently expects a mechListMIC or nothing to follow the
    mechTypes, but Windows 8 puts a mechToken field there instead to carry
    some info for the new NegoEx stuff.
    
    In practice, we don't do anything with the fields after the mechTypes
    anyway so I don't see any real benefit in continuing to parse them.
    This patch just has the kernel ignore the fields after the mechTypes.
    We'll probably need to reinstate some of this if we ever want to support
    NegoEx.

    Umm...  I see what you are describing, and AFAICS you are correct; let me
    see if I am misreading your analysis:
            * vfsmount_lock may act fair; A holding it shared, with B spinning
    on attempt to take it exclusive may lead to C spinning on attempt to take
    it shared.
            * path_is_under() tries get rename_lock while holding vfsmount_lock
    shared.
            * d_path() et.al. try to take vfsmount_lock shared, while holding
    rename_lock.
    
    All true and yes, it's a bug (I'd probably classify it as a livelock, but
    that doesn't make any real difference).  There are three possible solutions,
    AFAICS:
            1) two-liner in path_is_under() replacing the use of vfsmount_lock
    with that of namespace_sem; trivial, but results in function unexpectedly
    blocking.  The current callers are fine with that, but it's a trouble
    waiting to happen.
            2) replace write_seqlock() in prepend_path() callers with
    read_seqbegin/read_seqretry loops; bigger and more brittle, since unlike
    is_subdir() we need more than just ->d_parent not pointing to something
    freed - we also care about ->d_name.len being in sync with ->d_name.name.
    It probably can be worked around, but...
    
            3) declare that rename_lock nests inside vfsmount_lock and let
    the callers of prepend_path() take vfsmount_lock().  I'd probably prefer
    that one...
    
    Nest rename_lock inside vfsmount_lock
    
    ... lest we get livelocks between path_is_under() and d_path() and friends.
    
    [ add grsec-specific bits, thanks to Alexey Vlasov for his patience in reproducing
      the issue ]

    Upstream commit: 51f0885e5415b4cc6535e9cdcc5145bfbc134353
    
    vfs,proc: guarantee unique inodes in /proc
    
    Dave Jones found another /proc issue with his Trinity tool: thanks to
    the namespace model, we can have multiple /proc dentries that point to
    the same inode, aliasing directories in /proc/<pid>/net/ for example.
    
    This ends up being a total disaster, because it acts like hardlinked
    directories, and causes locking problems.  We rely on the topological
    sort of the inodes pointed to by dentries, and if we have aliased
    directories, that odering becomes unreliable.
    
    In short: don't do this.  Multiple dentries with the same (directory)
    inode is just a bad idea, and the namespace code should never have
    exposed things this way.  But we're kind of stuck with it.
    
    This solves things by just always allocating a new inode during /proc
    dentry lookup, instead of using "iget_locked()" to look up existing
    inodes by superblock and number.  That actually simplies the code a bit,
    at the cost of potentially doing more inode [de]allocations.
    
    That said, the inode lookup wasn't free either (and did a lot of locking
    of inodes), so it is probably not that noticeable.  We could easily keep
    the old lookup model for non-directory entries, but rather than try to
    be excessively clever this just implements the minimal and simplest
    workaround for the problem.

    mqueue: sys_mq_open: do not call mnt_drop_write() if read-only
    
    mnt_drop_write() must be called only if mnt_want_write() succeeded,
    otherwise the mnt_writers counter will diverge.
    
    mnt_writers counters are used to check if remounting FS as read-only is
    OK, so after an extra mnt_drop_write() call, it would be impossible to
    remount mqueue FS as read-only.  Besides, on umount a warning would be
    printed like this one:

    KVM: x86: Convert MSR_KVM_SYSTEM_TIME to use gfn_to_hva_cache functions (CVE-2013-1797)
    
    There is a potential use after free issue with the handling of
    MSR_KVM_SYSTEM_TIME.  If the guest specifies a GPA in a movable or removable
    memory such as frame buffers then KVM might continue to write to that
    address even after it's removed via KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION.  KVM pins
    the page in memory so it's unlikely to cause an issue, but if the user
    space component re-purposes the memory previously used for the guest, then
    the guest will be able to corrupt that memory.

    KVM: x86: fix for buffer overflow in handling of MSR_KVM_SYSTEM_TIME (CVE-2013-1796)
    
    If the guest sets the GPA of the time_page so that the request to update the
    time straddles a page then KVM will write onto an incorrect page.  The
    write is done byusing kmap atomic to get a pointer to the page for the time
    structure and then performing a memcpy to that page starting at an offset
    that the guest controls.  Well behaved guests always provide a 32-byte aligned
    address, however a malicious guest could use this to corrupt host kernel
    memory.

    KVM: Fix bounds checking in ioapic indirect register reads (CVE-2013-1798)
    
    If the guest specifies a IOAPIC_REG_SELECT with an invalid value and follows
    that with a read of the IOAPIC_REG_WINDOW KVM does not properly validate
    that request.  ioapic_read_indirect contains an
    ASSERT(redir_index < IOAPIC_NUM_PINS), but the ASSERT has no effect in
    non-debug builds.  In recent kernels this allows a guest to cause a kernel
    oops by reading invalid memory.  In older kernels (pre-3.3) this allows a
    guest to read from large ranges of host memory.
    
    Tested: tested against apic unit tests.

    Update to pax-linux-3.8.2-test9.patch:
     arm changes from spender
      - removed userland access to the vectors page
      - removed obsolete sigreturn trampoline handling
      - added emulation for __kuser_get_tls
      - fixed missing uderef instrumentation in unaligned memory accessors (failed safe)
    - fixed recent sysfs/power_supply attr breakage reported by Steven Allen
    - hopefully fixed the remaining issues with aslr_gap accounting (http://forums.grsecurity.net/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=2960)
    - changed debian packager rules to include the compiler plugins, from Tyler Coumbes <coumbes@gmail.com>
    - fixed the sa_restorer leak discovered and reported by Emese Revfy (CVE-2013-0914, google chromium bug #177956)
    - new size overflow plugin from Emese that instruments a whole lot more code due to tracking function return values
      and more type casts as well. this found the above mentioned sa_restorer leak and would have protected against CVE-2013-0913.

    vfs: fix pipe counter breakage
    
    If you open a pipe for neither read nor write, the pipe code will not
    add any usage counters to the pipe, causing the 'struct pipe_inode_info"
    to be potentially released early.
    
    That doesn't normally matter, since you cannot actually use the pipe,
    but the pipe release code - particularly fasync handling - still expects
    the actual pipe infrastructure to all be there.  And rather than adding
    NULL pointer checks, let's just disallow this case, the same way we
    already do for the named pipe ("fifo") case.
    
    This is ancient going back to pre-2.4 days, and until trinity, nobody
    naver noticed.

    Upstream commit: 8aec0f5d4137532de14e6554fd5dd201ff3a3c49
    
    Fix: compat_rw_copy_check_uvector() misuse in aio, readv, writev, and security keys
    
    Looking at mm/process_vm_access.c:process_vm_rw() and comparing it to
    compat_process_vm_rw() shows that the compatibility code requires an
    explicit "access_ok()" check before calling
    compat_rw_copy_check_uvector(). The same difference seems to appear when
    we compare fs/read_write.c:do_readv_writev() to
    fs/compat.c:compat_do_readv_writev().
    
    This subtle difference between the compat and non-compat requirements
    should probably be debated, as it seems to be error-prone. In fact,
    there are two others sites that use this function in the Linux kernel,
    and they both seem to get it wrong:
    
    Now shifting our attention to fs/aio.c, we see that aio_setup_iocb()
    also ends up calling compat_rw_copy_check_uvector() through
    aio_setup_vectored_rw(). Unfortunately, the access_ok() check appears to
    be missing. Same situation for
    security/keys/compat.c:compat_keyctl_instantiate_key_iov().
    
    I propose that we add the access_ok() check directly into
    compat_rw_copy_check_uvector(), so callers don't have to worry about it,
    and it therefore makes the compat call code similar to its non-compat
    counterpart. Place the access_ok() check in the same location where
    copy_from_user() can trigger a -EFAULT error in the non-compat code, so
    the ABI behaviors are alike on both compat and non-compat.
    
    While we are here, fix compat_do_readv_writev() so it checks for
    compat_rw_copy_check_uvector() negative return values.
    
    And also, fix a memory leak in compat_keyctl_instantiate_key_iov() error
    handling.

    Initialize the mac address buffer with 0 as the driver specific function
    will probably not fill the whole buffer. In fact, all in-kernel drivers
    fill only ETH_ALEN of the MAX_ADDR_LEN bytes, i.e. 6 of the 32 possible
    bytes. Therefore we currently leak 26 bytes of stack memory to userland
    via the netlink interface.

    Date: Sat,  9 Mar 2013 16:52:21 +0100
    
    The dcb netlink interface leaks stack memory in various places:
    * perm_addr[] buffer is only filled at max with 12 of the 32 bytes but
      copied completely,
    * no in-kernel driver fills all fields of an IEEE 802.1Qaz subcommand,
      so we're leaking up to 58 bytes for ieee_ets structs, up to 136 bytes
      for ieee_pfc structs, etc.,
    * the same is true for CEE -- no in-kernel driver fills the whole
      struct,
    
    Prevent all of the above stack info leaks by properly initializing the
    buffers/structures involved.

    proc connector: reject unprivileged listener bumps
    
    While PROC_CN_MCAST_LISTEN/IGNORE is entirely advisory, it was possible
    for an unprivileged user to turn off notifications for all listeners by
    sending PROC_CN_MCAST_IGNORE. Instead, require the same privileges as
    required for a multicast bind.

    l2tp: Restore socket refcount when sendmsg succeeds
    
    The sendmsg() syscall handler for PPPoL2TP doesn't decrease the socket
    reference counter after successful transmissions. Any successful
    sendmsg() call from userspace will then increase the reference counter
    forever, thus preventing the kernel's session and tunnel data from
    being freed later on.
    
    The problem only happens when writing directly on L2TP sockets.
    PPP sockets attached to L2TP are unaffected as the PPP subsystem
    uses pppol2tp_xmit() which symmetrically increase/decrease reference
    counters.
    
    This patch adds the missing call to sock_put() before returning from
    pppol2tp_sendmsg().

    Update to pax-linux-3.8.2-test4.patch:
     fixed arm compilation problems reported by Michael Tremer
    - the constify plugin got smarter that enabled, with some additional patching,
      the elimination of about half the static function pointers on amd64/allmod
      (up from about 18%), depending on the kernel config it can be even more (70%)

    spamming of the kernel log buffer (and since it includes the changable
    process name, can avoid syslog log deduplication)
    Turn it off by default

    Initial support for user namespaces, as we previously didn't allow
    the option to be enabled at all.
    
    RBAC will act on the global uids/gids only, so all uids/gids in user
    namespaces will be converted
    
    Because Eric Biederman is insulted that I didn't support his
    backdoor prior to it receiving proper review.  I still have the CAP_SYS_ADMIN
    check in for user namespaces, so this is generally irrelevant.

    Upstream commit: 09884964335e85e897876d17783c2ad33cf8a2e0
    
    mm: do not grow the stack vma just because of an overrun on preceding vma
    
    The stack vma is designed to grow automatically (marked with VM_GROWSUP
    or VM_GROWSDOWN depending on architecture) when an access is made beyond
    the existing boundary.  However, particularly if you have not limited
    your stack at all ("ulimit -s unlimited"), this can cause the stack to
    grow even if the access was really just one past *another* segment.
    
    And that's wrong, especially since we first grow the segment, but then
    immediately later enforce the stack guard page on the last page of the
    segment.  So _despite_ first growing the stack segment as a result of
    the access, the kernel will then make the access cause a SIGSEGV anyway!
    
    So do the same logic as the guard page check does, and consider an
    access to within one page of the next segment to be a bad access, rather
    than growing the stack to abut the next segment.

    x86: Make sure we can boot in the case the BDA contains pure garbage
    
    On non-BIOS platforms it is possible that the BIOS data area contains
    garbage instead of being zeroed or something equivalent (firmware
    people: we are talking of 1.5K here, so please do the sane thing.)
    
    We need on the order of 20-30K of low memory in order to boot, which
    may grow up to < 64K in the future.  We probably want to avoid the
    lowest of the low memory.  At the same time, it seems extremely
    unlikely that a legitimate EBDA would ever reach down to the 128K
    (which would require it to be over half a megabyte in size.)  Thus,
    pick 128K as the cutoff for "this is insane, ignore."  We may still
    end up reserving a bunch of extra memory on the low megabyte, but that
    is not really a major issue these days.  In the worst case we lose
    512K of RAM.
    
    This code really should be merged with trim_bios_range() in
    arch/x86/kernel/setup.c, but that is a bigger patch for a later merge
    window.

    Upstream commit: 6cdae7416a1c45c2ce105a78187d9b7e8feb9e24
    
    idr: fix a subtle bug in idr_get_next()
    
    The iteration logic of idr_get_next() is borrowed mostly verbatim from
    idr_for_each().  It walks down the tree looking for the slot matching
    the current ID.  If the matching slot is not found, the ID is
    incremented by the distance of single slot at the given level and
    repeats.
    
    The implementation assumes that during the whole iteration id is aligned
    to the layer boundaries of the level closest to the leaf, which is true
    for all iterations starting from zero or an existing element and thus is
    fine for idr_for_each().
    
    However, idr_get_next() may be given any point and if the starting id
    hits in the middle of a non-existent layer, increment to the next layer
    will end up skipping the same offset into it.  For example, an IDR with
    IDs filled between [64, 127] would look like the following.
    
              [  0  64 ... ]
           /----/   |
           |        |
          NULL    [ 64 ... 127 ]
    
    If idr_get_next() is called with 63 as the starting point, it will try
    to follow down the pointer from 0.  As it is NULL, it will then try to
    proceed to the next slot in the same level by adding the slot distance
    at that level which is 64 - making the next try 127.  It goes around the
    loop and finds and returns 127 skipping [64, 126].
    
    Note that this bug also triggers in idr_for_each_entry() loop which
    deletes during iteration as deletions can make layers go away leaving
    the iteration with unaligned ID into missing layers.
    
    Fix it by ensuring proceeding to the next slot doesn't carry over the
    unaligned offset - ie.  use round_up(id + 1, slot_distance) instead of
    id += slot_distance.

    Fix upstream vulnerability from addition of a /dev/kmsg device
    while neglecting to add the same set of existing permission checks

    A temporary workaround without this patch would be to
    chmod 0600 /dev/kmsg (and is likely a good idea anyway).

    KEYS: Revert one application of "Fix unreachable code" patch
    
    A patch to fix some unreachable code in search_my_process_keyrings() got
    applied twice by two different routes upstream as commits e67eab39bee2
    and b010520ab3d2 (both "fix unreachable code").
    
    Unfortunately, the second application removed something it shouldn't
    have and this wasn't detected by GIT.  This is due to the patch not
    having sufficient lines of context to distinguish the two places of
    application.
    
    The effect of this is relatively minor: inside the kernel, the keyring
    search routines may search multiple keyrings and then prioritise the
    errors if no keys or negative keys are found in any of them.  With the
    extra deletion, the presence of a negative key in the thread keyring
    (causing ENOKEY) is incorrectly overridden by an error searching the
    process keyring.
    
    So revert the second application of the patch.

    tty vt: fix character insertion overflow
    
    Commit 81732c3b2fed ("tty vt: Fix line garbage in virtual console on

    commit b1a925f44a3a ("tty vt: Fix a regression in command line edition")
    partially fixed it.  However, the buffer being moved is still too large
    and overflowing beyond the end of the current line, corrupting existing
    characters on the next line.
    
    Example test case:
    
    echo -e "abc\nde\x1b[A\x1b[4h \x1b[4l\x1b[B"
    
    Expected result:

    sched: Fix select_idle_sibling() bouncing cow syndrome
    
    If the previous CPU is cache affine and idle, select it.
    
    The current implementation simply traverses the sd_llc domain,
    taking the first idle CPU encountered, which walks buddy pairs
    hand in hand over the package, inflicting excruciating pain.

    userns: Avoid recursion in put_user_ns
    
    When freeing a deeply nested user namespace free_user_ns calls
    put_user_ns on it's parent which may in turn call free_user_ns again.
    When -fno-optimize-sibling-calls is passed to gcc one stack frame per
    user namespace is left on the stack, potentially overflowing the
    kernel stack.  CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER forces -fno-optimize-sibling-calls
    so we can't count on gcc to optimize this code.
    
    Remove struct kref and use a plain atomic_t.  Making the code more
    flexible and easier to comprehend.  Make the loop in free_user_ns
    explict to guarantee that the stack does not overflow with
    CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER enabled.
    
    I have tested this fix with a simple program that uses unshare to
    create a deeply nested user namespace structure and then calls exit.
    With 1000 nesteuser namespaces before this change running my test
    program causes the kernel to die a horrible death.  With 10,000,000
    nested user namespaces after this change my test program runs to
    completion and causes no harm.

Author: Greg Thelen <gthelen@google.com>

    Upstream fix: 5f00110f7273f9ff04ac69a5f85bb535a4fd0987
    
    tmpfs: fix use-after-free of mempolicy object
    
    The tmpfs remount logic preserves filesystem mempolicy if the mpol=M
    option is not specified in the remount request.  A new policy can be
    specified if mpol=M is given.
    
    Before this patch remounting an mpol bound tmpfs without specifying
    mpol= mount option in the remount request would set the filesystem's
    mempolicy object to a freed mempolicy object.
    
    To reproduce the problem boot a DEBUG_PAGEALLOC kernel and run:
        # mkdir /tmp/x
    
        # mount -t tmpfs -o size=100M,mpol=interleave nodev /tmp/x
    
        # grep /tmp/x /proc/mounts
        nodev /tmp/x tmpfs rw,relatime,size=102400k,mpol=interleave:0-3 0 0
    
        # mount -o remount,size=200M nodev /tmp/x
    
        # grep /tmp/x /proc/mounts
        nodev /tmp/x tmpfs rw,relatime,size=204800k,mpol=??? 0 0
            # note ? garbage in mpol=... output above
    
        # dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/x/f count=1
            # panic here
    
    Panic:
        BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at           (null)
        IP: [<          (null)>]           (null)
        [...]

          cstar_dispatch+0x7/0x1f
    
    Non-debug kernels will not crash immediately because referencing the
    dangling mpol will not cause a fault.  Instead the filesystem will
    reference a freed mempolicy object, which will cause unpredictable
    behavior.
    
    The problem boils down to a dropped mpol reference below if
    shmem_parse_options() does not allocate a new mpol:
    
        config = *sbinfo
        shmem_parse_options(data, &config, true)
        mpol_put(sbinfo->mpol)
        sbinfo->mpol = config.mpol  /* BUG: saves unreferenced mpol */
    
    This patch avoids the crash by not releasing the mempolicy if
    shmem_parse_options() doesn't create a new mpol.
    
    How far back does this issue go? I see it in both 2.6.36 and 3.3.  I did
    not look back further.

    Userland can send a netlink message requesting SOCK_DIAG_BY_FAMILY
    with a family greater or equal then AF_MAX -- the array size of
    sock_diag_handlers[]. The current code does not test for this
    condition therefore is vulnerable to an out-of-bound access opening

    tcp: fix syncookie regression
    
    commit ea4fc0d619 (ipv4: Don't use rt->rt_{src,dst} in ip_queue_xmit())
    added a serious regression on synflood handling.
    
    Simon Kirby discovered a successful connection was delayed by 20 seconds
    before being responsive.
    
    In my tests, I discovered that xmit frames were lost, and needed ~4
    retransmits and a socket dst rebuild before being really sent.
    
    In case of syncookie initiated connection, we use a different path to
    initialize the socket dst, and inet->cork.fl.u.ip4 is left cleared.
    
    As ip_queue_xmit() now depends on inet flow being setup, fix this by
    copying the temp flowi4 we use in cookie_v4_check().

    tun: don't hold network namespace by tun sockets
    
    v3: added previously removed sock_put() to the tun_release() callback, because
    sk_release_kernel() doesn't drop the socket reference.
    
    v2: sk_release_kernel() used for socket release. Dummy tun_release() is
    required for sk_release_kernel() ---> sock_release() ---> sock->ops->release()
    call.
    
    TUN was designed to destroy it's socket on network namesapce shutdown. But this
    will never happen for persistent device, because it's socket holds network
    namespace.
    This patch removes of holding network namespace by TUN socket and replaces it
    by creating socket in init_net and then changing it's net it to desired one. On
    shutdown socket is moved back to init_net prior to final put.

    vfs: Correctly set the dir i_mutex lockdep class
    
    9a7aa12f3911853a introduced additional logic around setting the i_mutex
    lockdep class for directory inodes. The idea was that some filesystems
    may want their own special lockdep class for different directory
    inodes and calling unlock_new_inode() should not clobber one of
    those special classes.
    
    I believe that the added conditional, around the *negated* return value
    of lockdep_match_class(), caused directory inodes to be placed in the
    wrong lockdep class.
    
    inode_init_always() sets the i_mutex lockdep class with i_mutex_key for
    all inodes. If the filesystem did not change the class during inode
    initialization, then the conditional mentioned above was false and the
    directory inode was incorrectly left in the non-directory lockdep class.
    If the filesystem did set a special lockdep class, then the conditional
    mentioned above was true and that class was clobbered with
    i_mutex_dir_key.
    
    This patch removes the negation from the conditional so that the i_mutex
    lockdep class is properly set for directory inodes. Special classes are
    preserved and directory inodes with unmodified classes are set with
    i_mutex_dir_key.

    udf: Fix deadlock in udf_release_file()
    
    udf_release_file() can be called from munmap() path with mmap_sem held.  Thus
    we cannot take i_mutex there because that ranks above mmap_sem. Luckily,
    i_mutex is not needed in udf_release_file() anymore since protection by
    i_data_sem is enough to protect from races with write and truncate.

    sparc32: Add -Av8 to assembler command line.
    
    Newer version of binutils are more strict about specifying the
    correct options to enable certain classes of instructions.
    
    The sparc32 build is done for v7 in order to support sun4c systems
    which lack hardware integer multiply and divide instructions.
    
    So we have to pass -Av8 when building the assembler routines that
    use these instructions and get patched into the kernel when we find
    out that we have a v8 capable cpu.

    x86: Derandom delay_tsc for 64 bit
    
    Commit f0fbf0abc093 ("x86: integrate delay functions") converted
    delay_tsc() into a random delay generator for 64 bit.  The reason is
    that it merged the mostly identical versions of delay_32.c and
    delay_64.c.  Though the subtle difference of the result was:
    
     static void delay_tsc(unsigned long loops)
     {
    -	unsigned bclock, now;
    +	unsigned long bclock, now;
    
    Now the function uses rdtscl() which returns the lower 32bit of the
    TSC. On 32bit that's not problematic as unsigned long is 32bit. On 64
    bit this fails when the lower 32bit are close to wrap around when
    bclock is read, because the following check
    
           if ((now - bclock) >= loops)
           	  	break;
    
    evaluated to true on 64bit for e.g. bclock = 0xffffffff and now = 0
    because the unsigned long (now - bclock) of these values results in
    0xffffffff00000001 which is definitely larger than the loops
    value. That explains Tvortkos observation:
    
    "Because I am seeing udelay(500) (_occasionally_) being short, and
     that by delaying for some duration between 0us (yep) and 491us."
    
    Make those variables explicitely u32 again, so this works for both 32
    and 64 bit.

    aio: fix the "too late munmap()" race
    
    Current code has put_ioctx() called asynchronously from aio_fput_routine();
    that's done *after* we have killed the request that used to pin ioctx,
    so there's nothing to stop io_destroy() waiting in wait_for_all_aios()
    from progressing.  As the result, we can end up with async call of
    put_ioctx() being the last one and possibly happening during exit_mmap()
    or elf_core_dump(), neither of which expects stray munmap() being done
    to them...
    
    We do need to prevent _freeing_ ioctx until aio_fput_routine() is done
    with that, but that's all we care about - neither io_destroy() nor
    exit_aio() will progress past wait_for_all_aios() until aio_fput_routine()
    does really_put_req(), so the ioctx teardown won't be done until then
    and we don't care about the contents of ioctx past that point.
    
    Since actual freeing of these suckers is RCU-delayed, we don't need to
    bump ioctx refcount when request goes into list for async removal.
    All we need is rcu_read_lock held just over the ->ctx_lock-protected
    area in aio_fput_routine().

    aio: fix io_setup/io_destroy race
    
    Have ioctx_alloc() return an extra reference, so that caller would drop it
    on success and not bother with re-grabbing it on failure exit.  The current
    code is obviously broken - io_destroy() from another thread that managed
    to guess the address io_setup() would've returned would free ioctx right
    under us; gets especially interesting if aio_context_t * we pass to
    io_setup() points to PROT_READ mapping, so put_user() fails and we end
    up doing io_destroy() on kioctx another thread has just got freed...

    strict_strtoul() writes a long but ->gamma_mode only has space to store an

    mm: fix find_vma_prev
    
    Commit 6bd4837de96e ("mm: simplify find_vma_prev()") broke memory
    management on PA-RISC.
    
    After application of the patch, programs that allocate big arrays on the
    stack crash with segfault, for example, this will crash if compiled
    without optimization:
    
      int main()
      {
    	char array[200000];
    	array[199999] = 0;
    	return 0;
      }
    
    The reason is that PA-RISC has up-growing stack and the stack is usually
    the last memory area.  In the above example, a page fault happens above
    the stack.
    
    Previously, if we passed too high address to find_vma_prev, it returned
    NULL and stored the last VMA in *pprev.  After "simplify find_vma_prev"
    change, it stores NULL in *pprev.  Consequently, the stack area is not
    found and it is not expanded, as it used to be before the change.
    
    This patch restores the old behavior and makes it return the last VMA in
    *pprev if the requested address is higher than address of any other VMA.

    vsprintf: make %pV handling compatible with kasprintf()
    
    kasprintf() (and potentially other functions that I didn't run across so
    far) want to evaluate argument lists twice.  Caring to do so for the
    primary list is obviously their job, but they can't reasonably be
    expected to check the format string for instances of %pV, which however
    need special handling too: On architectures like x86-64 (as opposed to
    e.g.  ix86), using the same argument list twice doesn't produce the
    expected results, as an internally managed cursor gets updated during
    the first run.
    
    Fix the problem by always acting on a copy of the original list when
    handling %pV.

    regset: Prevent null pointer reference on readonly regsets
    
    The regset common infrastructure assumed that regsets would always
    have .get and .set methods, but not necessarily .active methods.
    Unfortunately people have since written regsets without .set methods.
    
    Rather than putting in stub functions everywhere, handle regsets with
    null .get or .set methods explicitly.

    exec: fix use-after-free bug in setup_new_exec()
    
    Setting the task name is done within setup_new_exec() by accessing
    bprm->filename. However this happens after flush_old_exec().
    This may result in a use after free bug, flush_old_exec() may
    "complete" vfork_done, which will wake up the parent which in turn
    may free the passed in filename.
    To fix this add a new tcomm field in struct linux_binprm which
    contains the now early generated task name until it is used.
    
    Fixes this bug on s390:

    Reported by lavish on IRC:
    If a suid/sgid binary did not learn any setuid/setgid call during learning,
    we would not any CAP_SETUID/CAP_SETGID capability to the task, nor
    any restrictions on uid/gid changes.  uid and gid can however be changed
    within a suid/sgid binary via setresuid/setresgid with ruid/rgid set to
    euid/egid.
    
    My fix:
    POSIX doesn't specify whether unprivileged users can perform the above
    setresuid/setresgid as an unprivileged user, though Linux has historically
    permitted them.  Modify this behavior when RBAC is enabled to require
    CAP_SETUID/CAP_SETGID for these operations.
    
    Thanks to Lavish for the report!

      http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1235667/
    
    for details).
    
    This has been updated since I last sent it as the creation of the new
    mm_access() function did almost exactly the same thing as parts of the
    previous version of this patch did.
    
    In order to use mm_access() even when /proc isn't enabled, we move it to
    kernel/fork.c where other related process mm access functions already
    are.

    proc: make sure mem_open() doesn't pin the target's memory
    
    Once /proc/pid/mem is opened, the memory can't be released until
    mem_release() even if its owner exits.
    
    Change mem_open() to do atomic_inc(mm_count) + mmput(), this only
    pins mm_struct. Change mem_rw() to do atomic_inc_not_zero(mm_count)
    before access_remote_vm(), this verifies that this mm is still alive.
    
    I am not sure what should mem_rw() return if atomic_inc_not_zero()
    fails. With this patch it returns zero to match the "mm == NULL" case,
    may be it should return -EINVAL like it did before e268337d.
    
    Perhaps it makes sense to add the additional fatal_signal_pending()
    check into the main loop, to ensure we do not hold this memory if
    the target task was oom-killed.

    eCryptfs: Infinite loop due to overflow in ecryptfs_write()
    
    ecryptfs_write() can enter an infinite loop when truncating a file to a
    size larger than 4G. This only happens on architectures where size_t is
    represented by 32 bits.
    
    This was caused by a size_t overflow due to it incorrectly being used to
    store the result of a calculation which uses potentially large values of
    type loff_t.

    eCryptfs: Check inode changes in setattr
    
    Most filesystems call inode_change_ok() very early in ->setattr(), but
    eCryptfs didn't call it at all. It allowed the lower filesystem to make
    the call in its ->setattr() function. Then, eCryptfs would copy the
    appropriate inode attributes from the lower inode to the eCryptfs inode.
    
    This patch changes that and actually calls inode_change_ok() on the
    eCryptfs inode, fairly early in ecryptfs_setattr(). Ideally, the call
    would happen earlier in ecryptfs_setattr(), but there are some possible
    inode initialization steps that must happen first.
    
    Since the call was already being made on the lower inode, the change in
    functionality should be minimal, except for the case of a file extending
    truncate call. In that case, inode_newsize_ok() was never being
    called on the eCryptfs inode. Rather than inode_newsize_ok() catching
    maximum file size errors early on, eCryptfs would encrypt zeroed pages
    and write them to the lower filesystem until the lower filesystem's
    write path caught the error in generic_write_checks(). This patch
    introduces a new function, called ecryptfs_inode_newsize_ok(), which
    checks if the new lower file size is within the appropriate limits when
    the truncate operation will be growing the lower file.
    
    In summary this change prevents eCryptfs truncate operations (and the
    resulting page encryptions), which would exceed the lower filesystem
    limits or FSIZE rlimits, from ever starting.

    eCryptfs: Make truncate path killable
    
    ecryptfs_write() handles the truncation of eCryptfs inodes. It grabs a
    page, zeroes out the appropriate portions, and then encrypts the page
    before writing it to the lower filesystem. It was unkillable and due to
    the lack of sparse file support could result in tying up a large portion
    of system resources, while encrypting pages of zeros, with no way for
    the truncate operation to be stopped from userspace.
    
    This patch adds the ability for ecryptfs_write() to detect a pending
    fatal signal and return as gracefully as possible. The intent is to
    leave the lower file in a useable state, while still allowing a user to
    break out of the encryption loop. If a pending fatal signal is detected,
    the eCryptfs inode size is updated to reflect the modified inode size
    and then -EINTR is returned.

    eCryptfs: Fix oops when printing debug info in extent crypto functions
    
    If pages passed to the eCryptfs extent-based crypto functions are not
    mapped and the module parameter ecryptfs_verbosity=1 was specified at
    loading time, a NULL pointer dereference will occur.
    
    Note that this wouldn't happen on a production system, as you wouldn't
    pass ecryptfs_verbosity=1 on a production system. It leaks private
    information to the system logs and is for debugging only.
    
    The debugging info printed in these messages is no longer very useful
    and rather than doing a kmap() in these debugging paths, it will be
    better to simply remove the debugging paths completely.

    config option
    
    First feature requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN to write to any sysctl entry via
    the syscall or /proc/sys.
    
    Second feature requires read access to a suid/sgid binary in order
    to ptrace it, preventing infoleaking of binaries in situations where
    the admin has specified 4711 or 2711 perms.  Feature has been
    given the config option CONFIG_GRKERNSEC_PTRACE_READEXEC and
    a sysctl entry of ptrace_readexec

    When an oops causes a panic and panic prints another backtrace it's pretty

    The second backtrace is quite redundant and not needed anyways.

    block: fail SCSI passthrough ioctls on partition devices
    
    Linux allows executing the SG_IO ioctl on a partition or LVM volume, and
    will pass the command to the underlying block device.  This is
    well-known, but it is also a large security problem when (via Unix
    permissions, ACLs, SELinux or a combination thereof) a program or user
    needs to be granted access only to part of the disk.
    
    This patch lets partitions forward a small set of harmless ioctls;
    others are logged with printk so that we can see which ioctls are
    actually sent.  In my tests only CDROM_GET_CAPABILITY actually occurred.
    Of course it was being sent to a (partition on a) hard disk, so it would
    have failed with ENOTTY and the patch isn't changing anything in
    practice.  Still, I'm treating it specially to avoid spamming the logs.
    
    In principle, this restriction should include programs running with
    CAP_SYS_RAWIO.  If for example I let a program access /dev/sda2 and
    /dev/sdb, it still should not be able to read/write outside the
    boundaries of /dev/sda2 independent of the capabilities.  However, for
    now programs with CAP_SYS_RAWIO will still be allowed to send the
    ioctls.  Their actions will still be logged.
    
    This patch does not affect the non-libata IDE driver.  That driver
    however already tests for bd != bd->bd_contains before issuing some
    ioctl; it could be restricted further to forbid these ioctls even for
    programs running with CAP_SYS_ADMIN/CAP_SYS_RAWIO.

    The function will then be enhanced to detect partition block devices

    audit: fix signedness bug in audit_log_execve_info()
    
    In the loop, a size_t "len" is used to hold the return value of
    audit_log_single_execve_arg(), which returns -1 on error.  In that
    case the error handling (len <= 0) will be bypassed since "len" is
    unsigned, and the loop continues with (p += len) being wrapped.
    Change the type of "len" to signed int to fix the error handling.
    
    	size_t len;
    	...
    	for (...) {
    		len = audit_log_single_execve_arg(...);

    mm/mempolicy.c: refix mbind_range() vma issue
    
    commit 8aacc9f550 ("mm/mempolicy.c: fix pgoff in mbind vma merge") is the
    slightly incorrect fix.
    
    Why? Think following case.
    
    1. map 4 pages of a file at offset 0
    
       [0123]
    
    2. map 2 pages just after the first mapping of the same file but with
       page offset 2
    
       [0123][23]
    
    3. mbind() 2 pages from the first mapping at offset 2.
       mbind_range() should treat new vma is,
    
       [0123][23]
         |23|
         mbind vma
    
       but it does
    
       [0123][23]
         |01|
         mbind vma
    
       Oops. then, it makes wrong vma merge and splitting ([01][0123] or similar).
    
    This patch fixes it.

    nilfs2: potential integer overflow in nilfs_ioctl_clean_segments()
    
    There is a potential integer overflow in nilfs_ioctl_clean_segments().
    When a large argv[n].v_nmembs is passed from the userspace, the subsequent
    call to vmalloc() will allocate a buffer smaller than expected, which
    leads to out-of-bound access in nilfs_ioctl_move_blocks() and
    lfs_clean_segments().
    
    The following check does not prevent the overflow because nsegs is also
    controlled by the userspace and could be very large.

    binary_sysctl(): fix memory leak
    
    binary_sysctl() calls sysctl_getname() which allocates from names_cache
    slab usin __getname()
    
    The matching function to free the name is __putname(), and not putname()
    which should be used only to match getname() allocations.
    
    This is because when auditing is enabled, putname() calls audit_putname
    *instead* (not in addition) to __putname().  Then, if a syscall is in
    progress, audit_putname does not release the name - instead, it expects
    the name to get released when the syscall completes, but that will happen
    only if audit_getname() was called previously, i.e.  if the name was
    allocated with getname() rather than the naked __getname().  So,
    __getname() followed by putname() ends up leaking memory.

    RDMA/cma: Verify private data length
    
    private_data_len is defined as a u8.  If the user specifies a large
    private_data size (> 220 bytes), we will calculate a total length that
    exceeds 255, resulting in private_data_len wrapping back to 0.  This
    can lead to overwriting random kernel memory.  Avoid this by verifying
    that the resulting size fits into a u8.

    sctp: fix incorrect overflow check on autoclose
    
    Commit 8ffd3208 voids the previous patches f6778aab and 810c0719 for
    limiting the autoclose value.  If userspace passes in -1 on 32-bit
    platform, the overflow check didn't work and autoclose would be set
    to 0xffffffff.
    
    This patch defines a max_autoclose (in seconds) for limiting the value
    and exposes it through sysctl, with the following intentions.
    
    1) Avoid overflowing autoclose * HZ.
    
    2) Keep the default autoclose bound consistent across 32- and 64-bit
       platforms (INT_MAX / HZ in this patch).
    
    3) Keep the autoclose value consistent between setsockopt() and
       getsockopt() calls.

    vmwgfx: fix incorrect VRAM size check in vmw_kms_fb_create()
    
    Commit e133e737 didn't correctly fix the integer overflow issue.
    
    -	unsigned int required_size;
    +	u64 required_size;
    	...
    	required_size = mode_cmd->pitch * mode_cmd->height;
    -	if (unlikely(required_size > dev_priv->vram_size)) {
    +	if (unlikely(required_size > (u64) dev_priv->vram_size)) {
    
    Note that both pitch and height are u32.  Their product is still u32 and
    would overflow before being assigned to required_size.  A correct way is
    to convert pitch and height to u64 before the multiplication.
    
    	required_size = (u64)mode_cmd->pitch * (u64)mode_cmd->height;
    
    This patch calls the existing vmw_kms_validate_mode_vram() for
    validation.

    rps: fix insufficient bounds checking in store_rps_dev_flow_table_cnt()
    
    Setting a large rps_flow_cnt like (1 << 30) on 32-bit platform will
    cause a kernel oops due to insufficient bounds checking.
    
    	if (count > 1<<30) {
    		/* Enforce a limit to prevent overflow */
    		return -EINVAL;
    	}
    	count = roundup_pow_of_two(count);
    	table = vmalloc(RPS_DEV_FLOW_TABLE_SIZE(count));
    
    Note that the macro RPS_DEV_FLOW_TABLE_SIZE(count) is defined as:
    
    	... + (count * sizeof(struct rps_dev_flow))
    
    where sizeof(struct rps_dev_flow) is 8.  (1 << 30) * 8 will overflow
    32 bits.
    
    This patch replaces the magic number (1 << 30) with a symbolic bound.

    Fix freeze reported by 'vs' on the forums.  Bug occurred due to
    MAY_NOT_BLOCK added to Linux 3.1.  Our logging code, when a capability used
    in generic_permission() was in the task's effective set but disallowed by
    RBAC, would block when acquiring locks resulting in the freeze.
    
    Also update the ordering of checks so that CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH isn't logged
    as being required when CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE is present (consistent with
    older patches).

    sctp: better integer overflow check in sctp_auth_create_key()
    
    The check from commit 30c2235c is incomplete and cannot prevent
    cases like key_len = 0x80000000 (INT_MAX + 1).  In that case, the
    left-hand side of the check (INT_MAX - key_len), which is unsigned,
    becomes 0xffffffff (UINT_MAX) and bypasses the check.
    
    However this shouldn't be a security issue.  The function is called
    from the following two code paths:
    
     1) setsockopt()
    
     2) sctp_auth_asoc_set_secret()
    
    In case (1), sca_keylength is never going to exceed 65535 since it's
    bounded by a u16 from the user API.  As such, the key length will
    never overflow.
    
    In case (2), sca_keylength is computed based on the user key (1 short)
    and 2 * key_vector (3 shorts) for a total of 7 * USHRT_MAX, which still
    will not overflow.
    
    In other words, this overflow check is not really necessary.  Just
    make it more correct.

    fs/minix: Verify bitmap block counts before mounting
    
    Newer versions of MINIX can create filesystems that allocate an extra
    bitmap block.  Mounting of this succeeds, but doing a statfs call will
    result in an oops in count_free because of a negative number being used
    for the bh index.
    
    Avoid this by verifying the number of allocated blocks at mount time,
    erroring out if there are not enough and make statfs ignore the extras
    if there are too many.

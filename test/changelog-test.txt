    lguest: fix out-by-one error in address checking.
    
    This bug has been there since day 1; addresses in the top guest physical
    page weren't considered valid.  You could map that page (the check in
    check_gpte() is correct), but if a guest tried to put a pagetable there
    we'd check that address manually when walking it, and kill the guest.

    dm: fix casting bug in dm_merge_bvec()
    
    dm_merge_bvec() was originally added in f6fccb ("dm: introduce
    merge_bvec_fn").  In that commit a value in sectors is converted to
    bytes using << 9, and then assigned to an int.  This code made
    assumptions about the value of BIO_MAX_SECTORS.
    
    A later commit 148e51 ("dm: improve documentation and code clarity in
    dm_merge_bvec") was meant to have no functional change but it removed
    the use of BIO_MAX_SECTORS in favor of using queue_max_sectors().  At
    this point the cast from sector_t to int resulted in a zero value.  The
    fallout being dm_merge_bvec() would only allow a single page to be added
    to a bio.
    
    This interim fix is minimal for the benefit of stable@ because the more
    comprehensive cleanup of passing a sector_t to all DM targets' merge
    function will impact quite a few DM targets.

    d_walk() might skip too much
    
    when we find that a child has died while we'd been trying to ascend,
    we should go into the first live sibling itself, rather than its sibling.
    
    Off-by-one in question had been introduced in "deal with deadlock in
    d_walk()" and the fix needs to be backported to all branches this one
    has been backported to.

    udp: fix behavior of wrong checksums
    
    We have two problems in UDP stack related to bogus checksums :
    
    1) We return -EAGAIN to application even if receive queue is not empty.
       This breaks applications using edge trigger epoll()
    
    2) Under UDP flood, we can loop forever without yielding to other
       processes, potentially hanging the host, especially on non SMP.
    
    This patch is an attempt to make things better.
    
    We might in the future add extra support for rt applications
    wanting to better control time spent doing a recv() in a hostile
    environment. For example we could validate checksums before queuing
    packets in socket receive queue.

    If the specified maximum length of the string is a multiple of unsigned

    Update to pax-linux-4.0.4-test13.patch:
    - fixed arm compilation once again, reported by Michael Tremer <michael.tremer@ipfire.org>
    - Emese wrote a new gcc plugin called initify that moves some strings into freed-after-init memory, inspired by Mathias Krause (https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/8/21/255)
      - the result is a saving of a few pages worth of memory on typical configs
      - it is unconditionally enabled since it should not affect anything except reducing runtime memory usage a little bit
      - this can be further enhanced in various ways (propagation of __init/__exit annotations, more __nocapture annotations, etc)
    - fixed some section mismatch fallout brought out by the initify plugin

    md/raid0: fix restore to sector variable in raid0_make_request
    
    The variable "sector" in "raid0_make_request()" was improperly updated
    by a call to "sector_div()" which modifies its first argument in place.
    Commit 47d68979cc968535cb87f3e5f2e6a3533ea48fbd restored this variable
    after the call for later re-use.  Unfortunetly the restore was done after
    the referenced variable "bio" was advanced.  This lead to the original
    value and the restored value being different.  Here we move this line to
    the proper place.
    
    One observed side effect of this bug was discarding a file though
    unlinking would cause an unrelated file's contents to be discarded.

    Commit a series of patches from Peter Antoine that improve the security
    of the kernel's drm code:
    
    The following series of patches fix a number of security holes in the i915
    driver (actually in drm but...). The first three patches remove the actual
    security issues that have been found. The last two patches make the functions
    optional for all drivers. The only driver that has this feature turned on is
    the Nouveau driver, thus hopefully not breaking that driver.
    
    The patch set has been tested on the Intel platforms but has not been tested
    on the Nouveau driver. Hopefully someone with a working card and the right
    combination of drmlib can verify that the patches do what they say.
    
    There is a i-g-t test that goes with this patchset, but that test SHOULD NOT
    be run before the kernel is patches as the test will crash the driver and/or
    make the kernel panic.
    
    Peter Antoine (5):
      drm: Kernel Crash in drm_unlock
      drm: Fixes unsafe deference in locks.
      drm: Possible lock priority escalation.
      drm: Make HW_LOCK access functions optional.
      drm: Make Legacy Context access functions optional.

    usbnet: avoid integer overflow in start_xmit
    
    transfer_buffer_length is of type u32. It's therefore wrong to assign it
    to a signed integer. This patch avoids the overflow.
    
    It's worth noting that entry->length here is a long; perhaps it would be
    beneficial at somepoint to change this to be unsigned as well, if
    nothing else relies on its signedness for error conditions or the like.

    mnt: Fix fs_fully_visible to verify the root directory is visible
    
    This fixes a dumb bug in fs_fully_visible that allows proc or sys to
    be mounted if there is a bind mount of part of /proc/ or /sys/ visible.

    splice: sendfile() at once fails for big files
    
    Using sendfile with below small program to get MD5 sums of some files,
    it appear that big files (over 64kbytes with 4k pages system) get a
    wrong MD5 sum while small files get the correct sum.
    This program uses sendfile() to send a file to an AF_ALG socket
    for hashing.
    
    /* md5sum2.c */
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <unistd.h>
    #include <string.h>
    #include <fcntl.h>
    #include <sys/socket.h>
    #include <sys/stat.h>
    #include <sys/types.h>
    #include <linux/if_alg.h>
    
    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
    	int sk = socket(AF_ALG, SOCK_SEQPACKET, 0);
    	struct stat st;
    	struct sockaddr_alg sa = {
    		.salg_family = AF_ALG,
    		.salg_type = "hash",
    		.salg_name = "md5",
    	};
    	int n;
    
    	bind(sk, (struct sockaddr*)&sa, sizeof(sa));
    
    	for (n = 1; n < argc; n++) {
    		int size;
    		int offset = 0;
    		char buf[4096];
    		int fd;
    		int sko;
    		int i;
    
    		fd = open(argv[n], O_RDONLY);
    		sko = accept(sk, NULL, 0);
    		fstat(fd, &st);
    		size = st.st_size;
    		sendfile(sko, fd, &offset, size);
    		size = read(sko, buf, sizeof(buf));
    		for (i = 0; i < size; i++)
    			printf("%2.2x", buf[i]);
    		printf("  %s\n", argv[n]);
    		close(fd);
    		close(sko);
    	}
    	exit(0);
    }
    
    Test below is done using official linux patch files. First result is
    with a software based md5sum. Second result is with the program above.

    After investivation, it appears that sendfile() sends the files by blocks
    of 64kbytes (16 times PAGE_SIZE). The problem is that at the end of each
    block, the SPLICE_F_MORE flag is missing, therefore the hashing operation
    is reset as if it was the end of the file.
    
    This patch adds SPLICE_F_MORE to the flags when more data is pending.
    
    With the patch applied, we get the correct sums:

    path_openat(): fix double fput()
    
    path_openat() jumps to the wrong place after do_tmpfile() - it has
    already done path_cleanup() (as part of path_lookupat() called by
    do_tmpfile()), so doing that again can lead to double fput().

    Even though in the history of autoconfig it has never tripped anyone
    up under realistic use cases (e.g. nobody starts a config, enables
    only CONFIG_GRKERNSEC, then exits menuconfig, then loads it back up
    and tries to apply an autoconfig setting) explicitly mention that you
    cannot do it and expect the autoconfig to work.  Due to how the Kbuild
    system works, we can't apply defaults and also allow them to be modified
    via custom settings -- if they're 'select'ed then they can't be modified,
    and using 'select' violates any dependencies that may exist.  Therefore
    we have to resort to using 'default', which after a user has already chosen
    all the settings by virtue of enabling CONFIG_GRKERNSEC and then saving their
    complete kernel config, cannot have any effect as the options have now all
    been chosen and there's no 'default' applicable.

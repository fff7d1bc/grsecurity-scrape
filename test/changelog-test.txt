commit a7817402ac837b1aee07fac42537a02097055098
Author: Matt Fleming <matt@codeblueprint.co.uk>
Date:   Fri Jan 29 11:36:10 2016 +0000

    x86/mm/pat: Avoid truncation when converting cpa->numpages to address
    
    There are a couple of nasty truncation bugs lurking in the pageattr
    code that can be triggered when mapping EFI regions, e.g. when we pass
    a cpa->pgd pointer. Because cpa->numpages is a 32-bit value, shifting
    left by PAGE_SHIFT will truncate the resultant address to 32-bits.
    
    Viorel-Cătălin managed to trigger this bug on his Dell machine that
    provides a ~5GB EFI region which requires 1236992 pages to be mapped.
    When calling populate_pud() the end of the region gets calculated
    incorrectly in the following buggy expression,
    
      end = start + (cpa->numpages << PAGE_SHIFT);
    
    And only 188416 pages are mapped. Next, populate_pud() gets invoked
    for a second time because of the loop in __change_page_attr_set_clr(),
    only this time no pages get mapped because shifting the remaining
    number of pages (1048576) by PAGE_SHIFT is zero. At which point the
    loop in __change_page_attr_set_clr() spins forever because we fail to
    map progress.
    
    Hitting this bug depends very much on the virtual address we pick to
    map the large region at and how many pages we map on the initial run
    through the loop. This explains why this issue was only recently hit
    with the introduction of commit
    
      a5caa209ba9c ("x86/efi: Fix boot crash by mapping EFI memmap
       entries bottom-up at runtime, instead of top-down")
    
    It's interesting to note that safe uses of cpa->numpages do exist in
    the pageattr code. If instead of shifting ->numpages we multiply by
    PAGE_SIZE, no truncation occurs because PAGE_SIZE is a UL value, and
    so the result is unsigned long.
    
    To avoid surprises when users try to convert very large cpa->numpages
    values to addresses, change the data type from 'int' to 'unsigned
    long', thereby making it suitable for shifting by PAGE_SHIFT without
    any type casting.
    
    The alternative would be to make liberal use of casting, but that is
    far more likely to cause problems in the future when someone adds more
    code and fails to cast properly; this bug was difficult enough to
    track down in the first place.

    x86/mm: Fix types used in pgprot cacheability flags translations
    
    For PAE kernels "unsigned long" is not suitable to hold page protection
    flags, since _PAGE_NX doesn't fit there. This is the reason for quite a
    few W+X pages getting reported as insecure during boot (observed namely
    for the entire initrd range).

    Before this patch, a process with some permissive seccomp filter
    that was applied by root without NO_NEW_PRIVS was able to add
    more filters to itself without setting NO_NEW_PRIVS by setting
    the new filter from a throwaway thread with NO_NEW_PRIVS.

    tcp: fix zero cwnd in tcp_cwnd_reduction
    
    Patch 3759824da87b ("tcp: PRR uses CRB mode by default and SS mode
    conditionally") introduced a bug that cwnd may become 0 when both
    inflight and sndcnt are 0 (cwnd = inflight + sndcnt). This may lead
    to a div-by-zero if the connection starts another cwnd reduction
    phase by setting tp->prior_cwnd to the current cwnd (0) in
    tcp_init_cwnd_reduction().
    
    To prevent this we skip PRR operation when nothing is acked or
    sacked. Then cwnd must be positive in all cases as long as ssthresh
    is positive:
    
    1) The proportional reduction mode
       inflight > ssthresh > 0
    
    2) The reduction bound mode
      a) inflight == ssthresh > 0
    
      b) inflight < ssthresh
         sndcnt > 0 since newly_acked_sacked > 0 and inflight < ssthresh
    
    Therefore in all cases inflight and sndcnt can not both be 0.
    We check invalid tp->prior_cwnd to avoid potential div0 bugs.
    
    In reality this bug is triggered only with a sequence of less common
    events.  For example, the connection is terminating an ECN-triggered
    cwnd reduction with an inflight 0, then it receives reordered/old
    ACKs or DSACKs from prior transmission (which acks nothing). Or the
    connection is in fast recovery stage that marks everything lost,
    but fails to retransmit due to local issues, then receives data
    packets from other end which acks nothing.

    pptp: fix illegal memory access caused by multiple bind()s
    
    Several times already this has been reported as kasan reports caused by
    syzkaller and trinity and people always looked at RCU races, but it is
    much more simple. :)
    
    In case we bind a pptp socket multiple times, we simply add it to
    the callid_sock list but don't remove the old binding. Thus the old
    socket stays in the bucket with unused call_id indexes and doesn't get
    cleaned up. This causes various forms of kasan reports which were hard
    to pinpoint.
    
    Simply don't allow multiple binds and correct error handling in
    pptp_bind. Also keep sk_state bits in place in pptp_connect.

    The ESP algorithms using CBC mode require echainiv. Hence INET*_ESP have

    netfilter: nf_conntrack: use safer way to lock all buckets
    
    When we need to lock all buckets in the connection hashtable we'd attempt to
    lock 1024 spinlocks, which is way more preemption levels than supported by
    the kernel. Furthermore, this behavior was hidden by checking if lockdep is
    enabled, and if it was - use only 8 buckets(!).
    
    Fix this by using a global lock and synchronize all buckets on it when we
    need to lock them all. This is pretty heavyweight, but is only done when we
    need to resize the hashtable, and that doesn't happen often enough (or at all).

    pipe: limit the per-user amount of pages allocated in pipes
    
    On no-so-small systems, it is possible for a single process to cause an
    OOM condition by filling large pipes with data that are never read. A
    typical process filling 4000 pipes with 1 MB of data will use 4 GB of
    memory. On small systems it may be tricky to set the pipe max size to
    prevent this from happening.
    
    This patch makes it possible to enforce a per-user soft limit above
    which new pipes will be limited to a single page, effectively limiting
    them to 4 kB each, as well as a hard limit above which no new pipes may
    be created for this user. This has the effect of protecting the system
    against memory abuse without hurting other users, and still allowing
    pipes to work correctly though with less data at once.
    
    The limit are controlled by two new sysctls : pipe-user-pages-soft, and
    pipe-user-pages-hard. Both may be disabled by setting them to zero. The
    default soft limit allows the default number of FDs per process (1024)
    to create pipes of the default size (64kB), thus reaching a limit of 64MB
    before starting to create only smaller pipes. With 256 processes limited
    to 1024 FDs each, this results in 1024*64kB + (256*1024 - 1024) * 4kB =
    1084 MB of memory allocated for a user. The hard limit is disabled by
    default to avoid breaking existing applications that make intensive use
    of pipes (eg: for splicing).

    compat_ioctl: don't call do_ioctl under set_fs(KERNEL_DS)
    
    This replaces all code in fs/compat_ioctl.c that translated
    ioctl arguments into a in-kernel structure, then performed
    do_ioctl under set_fs(KERNEL_DS), with code that allocates
    data on the user stack and can call the VFS ioctl handler
    under USER_DS.
    
    This is done as a hardening measure because the caller
    does not know what kind of ioctl handler will be invoked,
    only that no corresponding compat_ioctl handler exists and
    what the ioctl command number is. The accidental
    invocation of an unlocked_ioctl handler that unexpectedly
    calls copy_to_user could be a severe security issue.

    compat_ioctl: don't look up the fd twice
    
    In code in fs/compat_ioctl.c that translates ioctl arguments
    into a in-kernel structure, then performs sys_ioctl, possibly
    under set_fs(KERNEL_DS), this commit changes the sys_ioctl
    calls to do_ioctl calls. do_ioctl is a new function that does
    the same thing as sys_ioctl, but doesn't look up the fd again.
    
    This change is made to avoid (potential) security issues
    because of ioctl handlers that accept one of the ioctl
    commands I2C_FUNCS, VIDEO_GET_EVENT, MTIOCPOS, MTIOCGET,
    TIOCGSERIAL, TIOCSSERIAL, RTC_IRQP_READ, RTC_EPOCH_READ.
    This can happen for multiple reasons:
    
     - The ioctl command number could be reused.
     - The ioctl handler might not check the full ioctl
       command. This is e.g. true for drm_ioctl.
     - The ioctl handler is very special, e.g. cuse_file_ioctl
    
    The real issue is that set_fs(KERNEL_DS) is used here,
    but that's fixed in a separate commit
    "compat_ioctl: don't call do_ioctl under set_fs(KERNEL_DS)".
    
    This change mitigates potential security issues by
    preventing a race that permits invocation of
    unlocked_ioctl handlers under KERNEL_DS through compat
    code even if a corresponding compat_ioctl handler exists.
    
    So far, no way has been identified to use this to damage
    kernel memory without having CAP_SYS_ADMIN in the init ns
    (with the capability, doing reads/writes at arbitrary
    kernel addresses should be easy through CUSE's ioctl
    handler with FUSE_IOCTL_UNRESTRICTED set).

    ALSA: hrtimer: Fix stall by hrtimer_cancel()
    
    hrtimer_cancel() waits for the completion from the callback, thus it
    must not be called inside the callback itself.  This was already a
    problem in the past with ALSA hrtimer driver, and the early commit
    [fcfdebe70759: ALSA: hrtimer - Fix lock-up] tried to address it.
    
    However, the previous fix is still insufficient: it may still cause a
    lockup when the ALSA timer instance reprograms itself in its callback.
    Then it invokes the start function even in snd_timer_interrupt() that
    is called in hrtimer callback itself, results in a CPU stall.  This is
    no hypothetical problem but actually triggered by syzkaller fuzzer.
    
    This patch tries to fix the issue again.  Now we call
    hrtimer_try_to_cancel() at both start and stop functions so that it
    won't fall into a deadlock, yet giving some chance to cancel the queue
    if the functions have been called outside the callback.  The proper
    hrtimer_cancel() is called in anyway at closing, so this should be
    enough.

    ALSA: timer: Harden slave timer list handling
    
    A slave timer instance might be still accessible in a racy way while
    operating the master instance as it lacks of locking.  Since the
    master operation is mostly protected with timer->lock, we should cope
    with it while changing the slave instance, too.  Also, some linked
    lists (active_list and ack_list) of slave instances aren't unlinked
    immediately at stopping or closing, and this may lead to unexpected
    accesses.
    
    This patch tries to address these issues.  It adds spin lock of
    timer->lock (either from master or slave, which is equivalent) in a
    few places.  For avoiding a deadlock, we ensure that the global
    slave_active_lock is always locked at first before each timer lock.
    
    Also, ack and active_list of slave instances are properly unlinked at
    snd_timer_stop() and snd_timer_close().
    
    Last but not least, remove the superfluous call of _snd_timer_stop()
    at removing slave links.  This is a noop, and calling it may confuse
    readers wrt locking.  Further cleanup will follow in a later patch.
    
    Actually we've got reports of use-after-free by syzkaller fuzzer, and
    this hopefully fixes these issues.

    ALSA: timer: Fix race among timer ioctls
    
    ALSA timer ioctls have an open race and this may lead to a
    use-after-free of timer instance object.  A simplistic fix is to make
    each ioctl exclusive.  We have already tread_sem for controlling the
    tread, and extend this as a global mutex to be applied to each ioctl.
    
    The downside is, of course, the worse concurrency.  But these ioctls
    aren't to be parallel accessible, in anyway, so it should be fine to
    serialize there.

    ALSA: timer: Fix double unlink of active_list
    
    ALSA timer instance object has a couple of linked lists and they are
    unlinked unconditionally at snd_timer_stop().  Meanwhile
    snd_timer_interrupt() unlinks it, but it calls list_del() which leaves
    the element list itself unchanged.  This ends up with unlinking twice,
    and it was caught by syzkaller fuzzer.
    
    The fix is to use list_del_init() variant properly there, too.

    ovs: limit ovs recursions in ovs_execute_actions to not corrupt stack
    
    It was seen that defective configurations of openvswitch could overwrite
    the STACK_END_MAGIC and cause a hard crash of the kernel because of too
    many recursions within ovs.
    
    This problem arises due to the high stack usage of openvswitch. The rest
    of the kernel is fine with the current limit of 10 (RECURSION_LIMIT).
    
    We use the already existing recursion counter in ovs_execute_actions to
    implement an upper bound of 5 recursions.

    As reported by Luis Ressel, the Kconfig help for GRKERNSEC_BRUTE
    mentioned banning execution of suid/sgid binaries, though the kernel
    source clearly only mentions banning execution of suid binaries.  Since
    there's no reason for us to not ban execution of sgid binaries as well,
    make the implementation match the Kconfig description.

    As pointed out by Jann Horn, some distros are starting to circumvent
    previous assumptions about the attainability of a user to control
    multiple UIDs by handing out suid binaries that allow a user to run
    processes (including exploits) under a number of other pre-defined
    UIDs.  As this could potentially be used to bypass GRKERNSEC_BRUTE
    (though it would have to involve some code path that doesn't involve
    locks) fix that here by ensuring no more than 8 users on a system can
    be banned before a reboot is required.  If more are banned, a panic
    is triggered.

    sctp: fix use-after-free in pr_debug statement
    
    Dmitry Vyukov reported a use-after-free in the code expanded by the
    macro debug_post_sfx, which is caused by the use of the asoc pointer
    after it was freed within sctp_side_effect() scope.
    
    This patch fixes it by allowing sctp_side_effect to clear that asoc
    pointer when the TCB is freed.
    
    As Vlad explained, we also have to cover the SCTP_DISPOSITION_ABORT case
    because it will trigger DELETE_TCB too on that same loop.
    
    Also, there were places issuing SCTP_CMD_INIT_FAILED and ASSOC_FAILED
    but returning SCTP_DISPOSITION_CONSUME, which would fool the scheme
    above. Fix it by returning SCTP_DISPOSITION_ABORT instead.
    
    The macro is already prepared to handle such NULL pointer.

    unix: properly account for FDs passed over unix sockets
    
    It is possible for a process to allocate and accumulate far more FDs than
    the process' limit by sending them over a unix socket then closing them
    to keep the process' fd count low.
    
    This change addresses this problem by keeping track of the number of FDs
    in flight per user and preventing non-privileged processes from having
    more FDs in flight than their configured FD limit.

    commit 8c7188b23474cca017b3ef354c4a58456f68303a upstream.
    
    Sasha's found a NULL pointer dereference in the RDS connection code when
    sending a message to an apparently unbound socket.  The problem is caused
    by the code checking if the socket is bound in rds_sendmsg(), which checks
    the rs_bound_addr field without taking a lock on the socket.  This opens a
    race where rs_bound_addr is temporarily set but where the transport is not
    in rds_bind(), leading to a NULL pointer dereference when trying to
    dereference 'trans' in __rds_conn_create().
    
    Vegard wrote a reproducer for this issue, so kindly ask him to share if
    you're interested.
    
    I cannot reproduce the NULL pointer dereference using Vegard's reproducer
    with this patch, whereas I could without.
    
    Complete earlier incomplete fix to CVE-2015-6937:

    RDS: verify the underlying transport exists before creating a connection
    
    There was no verification that an underlying transport exists when creating
    a connection, this would cause dereferencing a NULL ptr.
    
    It might happen on sockets that weren't properly bound before attempting to
    send a message, which will cause a NULL ptr deref:

    ftrace/module: Call clean up function when module init fails early
    
    If the module init code fails after calling ftrace_module_init() and before
    calling do_init_module(), we can suffer from a memory leak. This is because
    ftrace_module_init() allocates pages to store the locations that ftrace
    hooks are placed in the module text. If do_init_module() fails, it still
    calls the MODULE_GOING notifiers which will tell ftrace to do a clean up of
    the pages it allocated for the module. But if load_module() fails before
    then, the pages allocated by ftrace_module_init() will never be freed.
    
    Call ftrace_release_mod() on the module if load_module() fails before
    getting to do_init_module().

    mkiss: fix scribble on freed memory
    
    commit d79f16c046086f4fe0d42184a458e187464eb83e fixed a user triggerable
    scribble on free memory but added a new one which allows the user to
    scribble even more and user controlled data into freed space.
    
    As with 6pack we need to halt the queue before we free the buffers, because
    the transmit logic is not protected by the semaphore.

    6pack: fix free memory scribbles
    
    commit acf673a3187edf72068ee2f92f4dc47d66baed47 fixed a user triggerable free
    memory scribble but in doing so replaced it with a different one that allows
    the user to control the data and scribble even more.
    
    sixpack_close is called by the tty layer in tty context. The tty context is
    protected by sp_get() and sp_put(). However network layer activity via
    sp_xmit() is not protected this way. We must therefore stop the queue
    otherwise the user gets to dump a buffer mostly of their choice into freed
    kernel pages.

    net: filter: make JITs zero A for SKF_AD_ALU_XOR_X
    
    The SKF_AD_ALU_XOR_X ancillary is not like the other ancillary data
    instructions since it XORs A with X while all the others replace A with
    some loaded value.  All the BPF JITs fail to clear A if this is used as
    the first instruction in a filter.  This was found using american fuzzy
    lop.
    
    Add a helper to determine if A needs to be cleared given the first
    instruction in a filter, and use this in the JITs.  Except for ARM, the
    rest have only been compile-tested.

    af_unix: Fix splice-bind deadlock
    
    On 2015/11/06, Dmitry Vyukov reported a deadlock involving the splice
    system call and AF_UNIX sockets,
    
    http://lists.openwall.net/netdev/2015/11/06/24
    
    The situation was analyzed as
    
    (a while ago) A: socketpair()
    B: splice() from a pipe to /mnt/regular_file
    	does sb_start_write() on /mnt
    C: try to freeze /mnt
    	wait for B to finish with /mnt
    A: bind() try to bind our socket to /mnt/new_socket_name
    	lock our socket, see it not bound yet
    	decide that it needs to create something in /mnt
    	try to do sb_start_write() on /mnt, block (it's
    	waiting for C).
    D: splice() from the same pipe to our socket
    	lock the pipe, see that socket is connected
    	try to lock the socket, block waiting for A
    B:	get around to actually feeding a chunk from
    	pipe to file, try to lock the pipe.  Deadlock.
    
    on 2015/11/10 by Al Viro,
    
    http://lists.openwall.net/netdev/2015/11/10/4
    
    The patch fixes this by removing the kern_path_create related code from
    unix_mknod and executing it as part of unix_bind prior acquiring the
    readlock of the socket in question. This means that A (as used above)
    will sb_start_write on /mnt before it acquires the readlock, hence, it
    won't indirectly block B which first did a sb_start_write and then
    waited for a thread trying to acquire the readlock. Consequently, A
    being blocked by C waiting for B won't cause a deadlock anymore
    (effectively, both A and B acquire two locks in opposite order in the
    situation described above).

    tracing: Fix setting of start_index in find_next()

    Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception
    
    When the first time find_next calls find_next_mod_format, it should
    iterate the trace_bprintk_fmt_list to find the first print format of
    the module. However in current code, start_index is smaller than *pos
    at first, and code will not iterate the list. Latter container_of will
    get the wrong address with former v, which will cause mod_fmt be a
    meaningless object and so is the returned mod_fmt->fmt.
    
    This patch will fix it by correcting the start_index. After fixed,
    when the first time calls find_next_mod_format, start_index will be
    equal to *pos, and code will iterate the trace_bprintk_fmt_list to
    get the right module printk format, so is the returned mod_fmt->fmt.

    It was noticed during an internal audit that the code under GRKERNSEC_PROC_MEMMAP
    which aimed to enforce a 16MB minimum on RLIMIT_DATA for suid/sgid binaries only
    did so if RLIMIT_DATA was set lower than PAGE_SIZE.
    
    This addition was only supplemental as GRKERNSEC_BRUTE is the main defense
    against suid/sgid attacks and the flaw above would only eliminate the extra
    entropy provided for the brk-managed heap, still leaving it with the minimum
    of 16-bit entropy for mmap on x86 and 28 on x64.

commit 436201b6626b488d173c8076447000077c27b84a

    KEYS: Fix race between read and revoke
    
    This fixes CVE-2015-7550.
    
    There's a race between keyctl_read() and keyctl_revoke().  If the revoke
    happens between keyctl_read() checking the validity of a key and the key's
    semaphore being taken, then the key type read method will see a revoked key.
    
    This causes a problem for the user-defined key type because it assumes in
    its read method that there will always be a payload in a non-revoked key
    and doesn't check for a NULL pointer.
    
    Fix this by making keyctl_read() check the validity of a key after taking
    semaphore instead of before.
    
    I think the bug was introduced with the original keyrings code.
    
    This was discovered by a multithreaded test program generated by syzkaller
    (http://github.com/google/syzkaller).  Here's a cleaned up version:
    
    	#include <sys/types.h>
    	#include <keyutils.h>
    	#include <pthread.h>
    	void *thr0(void *arg)
    	{
    		key_serial_t key = (unsigned long)arg;
    		keyctl_revoke(key);
    		return 0;
    	}
    	void *thr1(void *arg)
    	{
    		key_serial_t key = (unsigned long)arg;
    		char buffer[16];
    		keyctl_read(key, buffer, 16);
    		return 0;
    	}
    	int main()
    	{
    		key_serial_t key = add_key("user", "%", "foo", 3, KEY_SPEC_USER_KEYRING);
    		pthread_t th[5];
    		pthread_create(&th[0], 0, thr0, (void *)(unsigned long)key);
    		pthread_create(&th[1], 0, thr1, (void *)(unsigned long)key);
    		pthread_create(&th[2], 0, thr0, (void *)(unsigned long)key);
    		pthread_create(&th[3], 0, thr1, (void *)(unsigned long)key);
    		pthread_join(th[0], 0);
    		pthread_join(th[1], 0);
    		pthread_join(th[2], 0);
    		pthread_join(th[3], 0);
    		return 0;
    	}
    
    Build as:
    
    	cc -o keyctl-race keyctl-race.c -lkeyutils -lpthread
    
    Run as:
    
    	while keyctl-race; do :; done
    
    as it may need several iterations to crash the kernel.  The crash can be
    summarised as:
    
    	BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000010
    	IP: [<ffffffff81279b08>] user_read+0x56/0xa3

    This is because we mistake a raw socket as a tcp socket.

    ptrace_has_cap() checks whether the current process should be
    treated as having a certain capability for ptrace checks
    against another process. Until now, this was equivalent to
    has_ns_capability(current, target_ns, CAP_SYS_PTRACE).
    
    However, if a root-owned process wants to enter a user
    namespace for some reason without knowing who owns it and
    therefore can't change to the namespace owner's uid and gid
    before entering, as soon as it has entered the namespace,
    the namespace owner can attach to it via ptrace and thereby
    gain access to its uid and gid.
    
    While it is possible for the entering process to switch to
    the uid of a claimed namespace owner before entering,
    causing the attempt to enter to fail if the claimed uid is
    wrong, this doesn't solve the problem of determining an
    appropriate gid.
    
    With this change, the entering process can first enter the
    namespace and then safely inspect the namespace's
    properties, e.g. through /proc/self/{uid_map,gid_map},
    assuming that the namespace owner doesn't have access to
    uid 0.

    net: fix uninitialized variable issue
    
    msg_iocb needs to be initialized on the recv/recvfrom path.
    Otherwise afalg will wrongly interpret it as an async call.

    ipv6: automatically enable stable privacy mode if stable_secret set
    
    Bjørn reported that while we switch all interfaces to privacy stable mode
    when setting the secret, we don't set this mode for new interfaces. This
    does not make sense, so change this behaviour.

Date:   Wed Dec 9 23:11:36 2015 -0500

    Update to pax-linux-4.3.1-test9.patch:
    - fixed __get_user on x86 to lie less about the size of the load, reported by peetaur (https://forums.grsecurity.net/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=4332)
    - Emese fixed an intentional overflow caused by gcc, reported by saironiq (https://forums.grsecurity.net/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=4333)
    - Emese fixed a false positive overflow report in the forcedeth driver, reported by fx3 (https://forums.grsecurity.net/viewtopic.php?t=4334)
    - Emese fixed a false positive overflow report in KVM's emulator, reported by fx3 (https://forums.grsecurity.net/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=4336)
    - Emese fixed the initify plugin to detect some captured use of __func__, reported by Rasmus Villemoes <linux@rasmusvillemoes.dk>
    - constrained shmmax and shmall to avoid triggering size overflow checks, reported by Mathias Krause <minipli@ld-linux.so>
    - the checker plugin can partially handle sparse's locking context annotations, it's context insensitive and thus not exactly useful for now, also see https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=59856
